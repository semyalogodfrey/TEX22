\title{INCREASING UNIVERSITY DROP OUTS AT MAKERERE}

\section{Introduction}
The Makerere University continues to have more drop out this is due to the research which i made considering\\
different colledges .A few samples of students which i interviewed gave me major reasons as to why this is so.

\subsection{ CAUSES OF CONSISTENT DROP OUTS AT MAKERERE}

Insufficient funds take them to take them on other remaining semesters.\\

Drug abuse by students who have bad peers and in the end loosing interest in studying.\\

Some students who pay for them selves and they are employed find the pressure for work and studying too heavy and ends up droping out.\\

Some Courses become too hard for students and ends  giving up.
